This my repository for the work for my Senior year Capstone Project (Stock news collection using Web Scraping and Stock price prediction) using Machine Learning Models.

## Overview
The goal is to build a machine learning model which is capable to take historical stock news using API or web scraping, and perform sentiment analysis on the headline of the news to predict the future outcome of the news in the stock market. Also, see a relation of other assests affecting the stock market.
